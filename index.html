        <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <div class = 'intro'>
        <div>
            <p>My name is Zach Pate, and I am a data scientist and data engineer (obviously not a front-end designer, per the simple website). </p>
            <p>I'm using this as a directory for different projects I'm working on, as well as to showcase the public work I do in my career.</p>
            <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>A little about me: I am a Senior Consultant for Deloitte's Government and Public Services Consulting practice, where I focus on data science 
                    and data engineering activities. The majority of my work has been focused on transportation demand analysis, such as building machine learning models 
                    to interpret traffic patterns and GHG emissions. I've also done data engineering work for the Deptartment of Transportation and for the Air Force, utilizing AWS cloud 
                    technologies. In my free time, I'm an avid road cyclist and pickleball player, and enjoy spending time outdoors with my wife Haley.
