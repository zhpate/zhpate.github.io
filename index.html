<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Zach Pate, and this is my personal Website. </p>
<p>I'm a data scientist and data engineer (obviously not a front-end designer, per the black and white website)</p>
<p>I'm using this as a directory for different projects I'm working on, as well as to showcase the public work I do in my career.</p>
